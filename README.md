# Maya Health Alliance OpenMRS Upgrade

## Description
The **Maya Health Alliance OpenMRS Upgrade** project focuses on upgrading the existing OpenMRS system used by the Maya Health Alliance to **Bahmni**, an enhanced and customizable healthcare IT system. This upgrade involves:
- Full customization of Bahmni.
- Installation and configuration of Bahmni's core components.
- Building new forms tailored to the facility's needs.

Bahmni is a comprehensive healthcare solution that integrates OpenMRS, Odoo (ERP), OpenELIS (lab system), and other modules to provide a seamless experience for healthcare facilities.

## Project Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to transition from the standalone OpenMRS system to a robust, integrated platform with Bahmni. This upgrade enhances functionality, improves workflows, and provides a more user-friendly system for managing healthcare data and operations.

## Usage

- **OpenMRS** for electronic medical records.
- **Odoo** for inventory and billing management.
- **OpenELIS** for laboratory information management.

With this integrated setup, the healthcare providers will experience a unified system that streamlines their operations.
